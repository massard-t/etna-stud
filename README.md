# Etna-Stud
Webapp aiming to provide students statistics about projects and stuff.

## Objectives

- Provide a simple and easy way of having informations about students at school
- Allow student to have views that may be missing on the intranet
  + Notes per projects (only notes per students are available)
  + "Ranking"
  + Maybe have a more concise view of logging time
- Quicker to access than the intranet


This project isn't aiming to replace the intranet.
Students have to check it every day, in order to have up-to-date informations
about their scholarity.

## Ideas

> Should be mirrored in issues

- Store data in MariaDB or something like it, in order to avoid having
  to look up every promotions and users each time a user wants his grade.
